Crystal Collector

Game Objective:
'Crystal Collector Game' is a game where the user's goal is to match the MAGIC NUMBER by adding the values together of each crystal. The goal is to reach the MAGIC NUMBER, without going over the value.


How to Play:
1. The page is loaded with a random number between 19-120 in the MAGIC NUMBER section and a value of 0 in the YOUR NUMBER section.
2. There are 4 crystals. Each crystal has a random value between 1-12 assigned to it.
3. The user must click on the crystals. Each click increases that value in the YOUR NUMBER section by the value assigned to that particular crystal.
4. The user should click on the crystals until YOUR NUMBER matches the MAGIC NUMBER
5. If YOUR NUMBER = MAGIC NUMBER, then the WINS value increases by 1; conversely, if YOUR NUMBER exceeds the MAGIC NUMBER, the LOSSES VALUE increases by 1

GOOD LUCK!!
